# Java Excercise - Cinema Seating
You are asked by a friend to create a program that can allow them to visualize seating in a cinema.
Among the various requests they make, they say they require the following:
1. The program must be able to print the number of seats per rows that is entered.
2. The program must allow for reservations to be made and seats to be picked. This must be reflected in the display.
3. The cost of tickets must be displayed when a reservation is made. (see more on that below.)
4. Depending on the size of the theatre the price of tickets can change.
   -  If there are 60 seats or less, then all tickets are $10.
   -  If there are more than 60 seats then the first half of the rows will be $10 and the rest will be $8
5. There should be a way to see how many tickets have been sold and the money made from those tickets and what the highest they can make by selling all seats

## Goals 
The goal of this excercise is to go through some of the basics of the Java programming language.
Namely, how to handle:
1. Input/Output
2. Variables
3. Methods
4. Scope
5. Loops
6. Decision Making
7. Arrays

## Accomplished Goals
At the end of this excercised I ended up learning about:
1. Input/Output
2. Variables
3. Scope
4. Methods
5. Loops (for, do..while)
6. Method Overloading (was removed as it was unnecessary)
7. Access Modifiers
8. Arrays (2D)
9. Decision Making
10. Type Parsing
